# Cloud Computing

In this repository, the content for the course Cloud Computing is maintained.

In this course, we will cover the journey from code to a scalable application running in the cloud. Therefore, we will learn how to build applications using continuous integration pipelines.
Subsequently, Kubernetes is introduced, enabling the automation of deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
